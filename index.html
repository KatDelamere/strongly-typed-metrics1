								<h3>Our mission</h3>
								<p>The METRICS lab for Social and Data Science at Mount Holyoke College invites students with varied interests and ambitions to model together what is possible in mixed-expertise teams while incorporating diverse perspectives and skill sets.</p>
									<p>As a student learning experience, METRICS Lab is situated in Sociology; however, several developing questions require interdisciplinary collaboration. Students interested in social science, data science, and computer science are working together and utilizing computational and text analysis methods to drive insights into historically important questions in the social sciences.
									</p>
									<p>Designed to support the learning goals of Mount Holyoke College, this lab provides students with an interactive way to study across disciplines, exploring different modes of inquiry while conducting collaborative research.
									</p>
									<p>METRICS Lab provides dedicated and intrepid students pursuing research at the highest level beyond the BA a pathway while inviting all students to realize they can reconfigure the world symbolically and make their mark on it through research or any other chosen pathway.
